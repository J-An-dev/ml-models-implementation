# Machine Learning Models Implementation
This repository is a collection of machine learning models implemented using Python. Most of them are built from scratch given the specific usage scenario. More detailed algorithms and scenario descriptions/datasets could be found in the subfolder named after each model topic.

The collection of machine learning models are:
1. [Ridge Regression](/Ridge-Regression/Ridge%20Regression.ipynb)
2. [Naive Bayes Classifier](/Naive-Bayes-Classifier/README.md)
3. [K-Nearest-Neighbors Classifier](/KNN-Classifier/README.md)
4. [Gaussian Process Model for Regression](/Gaussian-Process-Model-for-Regression/README.md)
