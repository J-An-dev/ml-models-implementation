# Machine Learning Models Implementation
This repository is a collection of machine learning models implemented using Python. Most of them are built from scratch given the specific use scenario by addressing all the mathematics with [NumPy](https://numpy.org/). More detailed algorithms and scenario descriptions/datasets could be found in the subfolder named after each model topic.

The collection of machine learning models are:
- Supervised Learning:
  1. [Ridge Regression](/Ridge-Regression/Ridge-Regression.ipynb)
  2. [Naive Bayes Classifier](/Naive-Bayes-Classifier/Naive-Bayes-Classifier.ipynb)
  3. [k-Nearest-Neighbors Classifier](/k-NN-Classifier/k-NN-Classifier.ipynb)
  4. [Gaussian Process Model for Regression](/Gaussian-Process-Model-for-Regression/Gaussian-Process-Model-for-Regression.ipynb)

- Unsupervised Learning:
  1. [K-Means](/K-Means/K-Means.ipynb)
  2. [Expectationâ€“Maximization (EM) Algorithm](/EM-Algorithm/EM-Algorithm.ipynb)
  3. [Matrix Factorization](/Matrix-Factorization/Matrix-Factorization.ipynb)
  4. [Markov Chains](/Markov-Chains/Markov-Chains.ipynb)
  5. [Nonnegative Matrix Factorization](/Nonnegative-Matrix-Factorization/Nonnegative-Matrix-Factorization.ipynb)
