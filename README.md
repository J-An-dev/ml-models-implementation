# Machine Learning Models Implementation
This repository is a collection of machine learning models implemented using Python. Most of them are built from scratch given the specific use scenario. More detailed algorithms and scenario descriptions/datasets could be found in the subfolder named after each model topic.

The collection of machine learning models are:
- Supervised Learning:
  1. [Ridge Regression](/Ridge-Regression/Ridge-Regression.ipynb)
  2. [Naive Bayes Classifier](/Naive-Bayes-Classifier/Naive-Bayes-Classifier.ipynb)
  3. [k-Nearest-Neighbors Classifier](/k-NN-Classifier/k-NN-Classifier.ipynb)
  4. [Gaussian Process Model for Regression](/Gaussian-Process-Model-for-Regression/Gaussian-Process-Model-for-Regression.ipynb)
